First off, the widgets. God, I love the widgets! The first thing I see after unlocking my phone is A) a list of all the stuff I need to be doing on that given day; and B) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that I need to also make time for. This was what I found was missing back when I used the ToDoIst app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. I suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. The widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the PC and web integrations. This was a ""must-have"" feature, because I've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them ""refreshed"" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. TickTick makes everything instant, to the point that a TickTick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. I really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what I'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. This also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. I've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually ""take over"" the entire screen, at which point I can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. There's a few areas I can see for quality-of-life improvements, though I'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the ""final"" iteration of this app for some time yet. A few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- To mark a habit as ""incomplete"", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'X' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. It's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your ""failures"" at all. It makes me wonder if there's other useful features I've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end UI + widgets. -- It would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end UI had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on ""streak"" for. You can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. I'd probably be more motivated to ""keep the streak going"" with a given habit if I could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --Also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. By which I mean, when I pull up my habits for Thursdayy, for instance, and I see ""exercise at gym"" in my list of habits for that day, then surely I should get some indication of ""you've been to the gym X times this week so far, and you have Y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]"". Again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. Maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, ADHD-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. But all in all, these are minor foibles. Fantastic app. 5/5.",5,91,5.8.3,04-10-2020 08:54,,,newest,com.ticktick.task

I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",1,2,1.5.1,25-10-2018 02:59,"Hi Jerome, thanks for your feedback, it's very helpful for us.

understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad

also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy)

can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a

Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work.

Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour.

I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads.

The purchase of Forest made in either iOS or Android is not transferable as Apple and Google sell the apps in their own market. As app developers, we are not in charge of the app-selling process.
You'd need to buy the iOS and Android versions separately, but you'll be able to use the same account on multiple devices on that platform.

Some other reviews have noted that too. The export option also seems iffy (at least when I tried to e-mail the export, nothing happend). And I found no import! Since I paid for the app I would expect these to be available. Will change stars if resolved. It's dissapointing because this is one of the best habit tracking app, but the lack of sync and export/inport function is a deal breaker. ((UPDATE (March 2015): What happened to the option to switch between the weekly and monthly view?!! It was very useful.)) I tried a number of other apps for habit tracking and this one is the best so far. Very clean and easy to navigate interface, useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage. I love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view. One suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures. I saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps. I actually used Habit Streak Pro for years and I did see HabitBul earlier, but the bull icon deterred me from trying it because I thought it looked really cheesy. The app behind this cheesy icon is actually the best of the habit trackers I have tried so far. Keep up the good job.",1,1,1.5.11,26-10-2019 02:18,"Hi Jan, thanks for the review.

Updated: logging features are still as good as ever, but since syncing is impossible, I can't see the forum anymore as my user doesn't properly log in and there is no customer service, I can't recommend it anymore...",2,53,1.5.11,16-04-2020 22:09,,,newest,com.oristats.habitbull
